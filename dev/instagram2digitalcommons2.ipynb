        "\n",
        "This Colab notebook is designed to help you transform an Instagram archive (the `.zip` file you download from Instagram) into structured packages that are easier to ingest into a Digital Commons (or similar) institutional repository.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tool was created with vibecoding. The workflow was varied but the most successful version was downloading the ipynb file from colab uploading it to aistudio gemini and asking to add the next cell, and playing with it until it worked, and repeating it for each piece of the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What you need to do:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Have a google account:**\n",
        "    *   To run this you'll need to log into a google account, or know enough magic to run this pile of python somewhere else.\n",
        "2.  **Provide your Instagram Archive:**\n",
        "    *   The first code cell will ask you how you want to provide your Instagram `.zip` file. You can either:\n",
        "        *   Upload it directly to this Colab session (suitable for smaller archives).\n",
        "        *   Place it in a specific folder (`MyDrive/i2dc/`) on your Google Drive and let the script find it (recommended for larger archives or repeated use).\n",
        "    *   Make sure you have your Instagram archive `.zip` file ready. You can request it from Instagram by going to your Profile -> Your Activity -> Download Your Information. **Crucially, request the data in JSON format and select High media quality.**\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Run the Cells Sequentially:**\n",
        "    *   Execute each code cell in this notebook from top to bottom by clicking the \"play\" button next to each cell or by using \"Runtime\" > \"Run all\".\n",
        "    *   The notebook will:\n",
        "        *   Extract the contents of your `.zip` file.\n",
        "        *   Scan the archive and provide a summary of its contents.\n",
        "        *   Attempt to fix common text encoding issues (mojibake) in captions and titles using `ftfy`.\n",
        "        *   Process **Reels**, **Stories**, and **Posts** separately.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What the notebook will produce:**\n",
        "\n",
        "For each content type (Reels, Stories, Posts), the notebook will:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Create a dedicated export folder** within the Colab environment (e.g., `/content/extracted_data/reels_export_dc_format/`).\n",
        "2.  **Copy and rename relevant media files** (videos, images) into this folder. For Reels, it will also include `.srt` subtitle files if they exist in your archive. Filenames are structured for clarity (e.g., `instagram_yourhandle_reel_YYYY-MM-DD_item-number_original-name.mp4`).\n",
        "3.  **Generate an Excel metadata file** (e.g., `reels_metadata_dc_format.xlsx`). This file is formatted with columns typically used for Digital Commons batch uploads (`title`, `fulltext_url`, `keywords`, `abstract`, etc.).\n",
        "    *   For **Posts** containing multiple media items (carousels), each media item will get its own row in the Excel sheet, sharing common post metadata but having a unique `fulltext_url`.\n",
        "    *   For **Stories** posted at the same time (grouped by timestamp), they will share common metadata like `title` and `abstract`, but each media item will have its own row and unique `fulltext_url`.\n",
        "4.  **Create a `README.txt` file** in the export folder, explaining the contents of that specific package, how metadata was generated, and a summary of processed/skipped items.\n",
        "5.  **Package these items into a single `.zip` file** (e.g., `reels_package_dc_format.zip`) within its export folder.\n",
        "6.  **Copy this package to `/content/batchup/`** and rename it (e.g., `reels.zip`, `stories.zip`, `posts.zip`).\n",
        "7.  **Offer this final `.zip` file for download** directly to your computer after each respective section (Reels, Stories, Posts) is processed.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will end up with three main downloadable `.zip` files: `reels.zip`, `stories.zip`, and `posts.zip`, each ready for further review and potential batch upload to Digital Commons.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important Notes:**\n",
        "*   This notebook processes media files that are *locally available* within your downloaded Instagram archive. It does **not** download content from web links (e.g., some older story links might point to Instagram's servers). The script attempts to skip these web links.\n",
        "*   The quality of the output depends on the completeness and structure of your Instagram archive.\n",
        "*   Always review the generated metadata and files before uploading to your repository.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's get started! Run the first code cell below (the one that asks how you want to provide the ZIP file)."
